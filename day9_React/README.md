#### Introduction
I followed [React Tutorial by The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i0_2FF-WhtRIfIJ1lXlTZR) to learn the basic of React, as well as how to set it up with Webpack and create a to-do list.

#### Instruction
1. Run `npm start` in the repository to run the webpack and webpack server.
1. Then navigate to http://localhost:1234/ to visit the web app.
