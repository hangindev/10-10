#### Introduction
On Dec 26 2016, I challenged myself to build 30 webpages in 30 days. Each day I will practice my web development skills and learn new frameworks through various projects, from styling a HTML form to building a web app.

Hopefully after these 30 days, my skills and workflow will be enhanced.
